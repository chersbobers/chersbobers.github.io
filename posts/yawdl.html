        <h3>About YAWDL</h3>
        <p>Yawdl stands for yet another web development language and is made to bundle html, css, and js/ts into easy to read language so you don't have to manage multiple files at once. Yawdl is still in very early development with only a few tags nativly these are style, script, ui, paget, import, image, and tt as well as supporting all html tags out of the box. Right now yawdl is compiling into html using a simple typescript compiler but I do want to make it support running with out compiling to html.
